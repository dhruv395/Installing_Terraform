Go to, 
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.14/terraform_0.11.14_linux_amd64.zip 
apt install unzip
unzip terraform_0.11.14_linux_amd64.zip
mkdir downloads
mv terraform /root/downloads/
ls -la
vim ~/.profile
export PATH="$PATH:~/downloads"
 source ~/.profile
terraform --version

Minimal viable configuration:

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

Note: If you simply leave out AWS credentials, Terraform will automatically search for saved API credentials 
(for example, in ~/.aws/credentials) or IAM instance profile credentials. This option is much cleaner for situations where tf 
files are checked into source control or where there is more than one admin user.

      apt install awscli
      aws configure
     
terraform init          ->which initializes various local settings and data that will be used by subsequent commands.
terraform plan          -> to see the execution plan before applying it
terraform apply         -> execute the file
terraform show          -> show the history 
terraform destroy       -> destroy the infrustructure
